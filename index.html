            <p>I want to be a full-stack web developer. But the main problem is, I am too lazy. I starts doing something, and after one or two weeks, i lost my dedication. But this time, Insha-Allah I won't do something like that. Insha-Allah I will learn everything to be a full-stack web developer. Keep me in your prayers. </p>
